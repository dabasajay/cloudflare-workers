#### What is it?

Cloudflare Software Engineering intern 2020 assignment submission.

#### Submission files:

- **index.js**: contains the code to be executed by the workers.
- **URL.txt**: contains the url of the hosted project.

I built and deployed this project using the awesome web-based Cloudflare workers dashboard. It was pretty easy to create and deploy a worker.

#### What did I learn?

I learned basics of Cloudflare workers. It provides a serverless platform to deploy your code and it's able to execute the code with very low latencies. I really liked the feature of deploying code over a network spread across the whole earth, all with a single click and you don't have to worry about different regions. It's a great addition to my skillset.
